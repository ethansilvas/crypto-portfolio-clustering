## Installation Guide

If you would like to run the program in JupyterLab, install the [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution) distribution and run `jupyter lab` in a conda dev environment.

To ensure that your notebook runs properly you can use the [requirements.txt](/Resources/requirements.txt) file to create an exact copy of the conda dev environment used to create the notebook. 

Create a copy of the conda dev environment with `conda create --name myenv --file requirements.txt`

Then install the requirements with `conda install --name myenv --file requirements.txt`

## Usage

The Jupyter notebook [crypto_investments.ipynb](/crypto_investments.ipynb) will provide all steps of the data collection, preparation, and analysis. Data visualizations are shown inline and accompanying analysis responses are provided.
